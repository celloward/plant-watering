# Tandem Plant Watering Schedule
This a solution to the Tandem Software Apprenticeship Application. As stated in the challenge guidelines, "Your goal is to create an application that generates a watering schedule for the next 12 weeks for all of
our plants." The following assumptions and acceptance criterion were provided:

* Project Assumptions
  * We do not water our plants on a weekend. Work-life balance is important, and we shouldn't be in
the office on a weekend.
  * Our plants are reasonably tolerant and will still be happy if they are watered a day before or after
the day they should be watered.
  * Watering an individual plant takes no time at all so you don't have to worry about how many
plants can be watered in a particular day.
  * The scheduling should start from next Monday and last for 12 weeks.
  * All plants will be watered on the first day of the schedule (next Monday).
  * We recognize that when to water a plant is heavily dependent on other factors such as soil,
weather, humidity, etc. You can assume that we know exactly when to water these specific plants.
  * You have been provided a JSON file which contains data for our plants.

* Acceptance Criterion
  * The user can view which plant(s) to water on which date(s).
  * The schedule covers the next 12 weeks starting next Monday.
  * No plants are watered on Saturdays or Sundays.
  * Each plant is watered on its desired schedule or as close as possible, taking into account weekends.
